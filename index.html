I choose to study in RMIT university because i heard this university is good at technology and i like this structure with a sense of technology. I want to learn advanced coding procedures, advanced science and technology principles, construction and use methods, and hope that the university can broaden my horizons and new ways of thinking.</br></span>

For example, the data shows that I tend to be more imaginative and energetic, which shows that I can bring some new ideas to my team and joy to relieve the pressure of the team to overcome problems. If I want to choose a team, I should not only refer to everyone’s strengths and shortcomings, but also give a chance to my friends, because once a person gets along with you for a long time, the cooperation of two people is irreplaceable, and each other can accept each other’s habits.

	     <div class ="s5h5"><b>Project Idea</b></div>
		 <div class ="s7h7">Overview</div>
		 <span class ="s2h2">The design uses single-chip microcomputer as the central controller, collects data on the traffic flow through sensors, and transmits the data to the control center through the A/D converter for data analysis and comparison. The signal lamp duration control system is designed according to the specific traffic flow. The traffic signal light can be changed according to the traffic volume, and a set of hardware circuits and corresponding software programs are designed. Then use the big data system and the Internet to upload the calculated vehicle to the cloud and synchronize to the major navigation systems and life app software. People on the move can see the crowded streets clearly and avoid it. Urban traffic light installations can effectively improve traffic congestion at intersections. </span>
		 <div class ="s7h7">Motivation </div>
		 <span class ="s2h2">As we all know, China is a country with a large population of 1.3 billion people and 9.6 million square kilometers. It is the third most populous country in the world, and as China is now getting better and better, people’s quality of life is rising. With the advancement of science and technology, more and more skyscrapers and traffic routes appear in the country. So with the advancement of technology, more and more people in the city own cars, so there are a lot of traffic jams. However, more traffic lights in China are presented in the form of a countdown. The original intention of this idea is to make the traffic lights intelligent so that people's waiting time is no longer fixed. </span>
		 <div class ="s7h7">Description </div>
		 <span class ="s2h2">There are more and more cars on the road, continuous changes in technology and technology, and continuous innovation in traffic light devices. There is still a problem of congestion in road traffic in my country, and there is still a lot of room for research on traffic lights. In the early stage of the design, the traffic flow situation at the intersection was investigated many times, and the sensors were used to collect and capture data on the road vehicle situation, and the collected data were sent to the control center for analysis. Design various functions required by the system, especially the duration control function. <br>For this reason, we put forward the general goal of system design, namely "practical, reliable, stable and environmentally friendly". It can effectively manage road traffic conditions, improve the traffic efficiency of crossroads, and reduce accidents caused by traffic lights. At the same time, reduce the probability of paralysis of the traffic light system. In addition, because China’s major apps such as WeChat Alipay and other lifestyle apps have the function of querying the geographic location and arrival time of buses, subways and other travel tools, it gave me inspiration: use the remote sensing function to calculate the vehicles passing the traffic lights through the sensors. Then upload the data to the cloud, and then synchronize the data to Internet apps such as wechat alipay, so that people traveling can clearly understand the crowded routes and plan better travel routes in time.</br><br>According to demand analysis, design a real-time control simulation device for traffic light duration, using a single-chip microcomputer as the main control chip to directly control the display of three traffic lights, time display, LED status indication, buzzer circuit, button circuit and duration control module. Components and traffic signal lights can automatically adjust the transit time according to the actual road traffic conditions, thereby effectively controlling the road traffic conditions.</br><br>By accurately counting the traffic flow, the current traffic situation can be judged. In this module, the sensor mainly collects real-time traffic flow data, and the information is captured by the sensor, which plays a role of collecting data in practical applications. The single-chip microcomputer receives the transmitted data. Perform analysis and processing, and write programs in the background, just like the human brain, which can automatically process and analyze data to achieve the purpose of intelligentization of the system.</br><br>Through the design of this module, the system can automatically adjust the flashing time of the red, green, and yellow lights according to the current number of cars to ensure that the current road is unblocked.</br><br>When the information collected from the sensor, it will be stored in the single-chip memory and used in the next round of time control. After the first round of traffic lights are over, the duration of the second round of traffic lights begins to change. In this way, the traffic time in the directions with more vehicles can be increased, and the road traffic will be smoother. For example: the default passage time of the first round is 20s, and the waiting vehicle number is greater than or equal to 10 vehicles at this time, the passage time of the second round will increase by 5s, and the passage time will become 25s.</br></span>
		 <div class ="s7h7">Tools and Technologies </div>
		 <span class ="s2h2">The chip machine is used as the main control chip to directly control the display of three kinds of traffic lights, time display, LED status indication, buzzer circuit, button circuit and time control module and other functional components, and the traffic signal lights can be adjusted according to the actual situation of road traffic. </span>
		 <div class ="s7h7">Skills Required </div>
		 <span class ="s2h2">The required skills first require a certain programming ability. The design of the system software is divided into seven modules: status light control program, traffic counting program, timer interrupt program, emergency mode program, traffic light time control program, keyboard setting processing program, LED display The program, the next required hardware is the circuit display. Need skills such as data statistics, line engineering, software writing, network maintenance, etc. </span>
		 <div class ="s7h7">Outcome </div>
		 <span class ="s2h2">Not only can it automatically allocate time for traffic lights according to the volume of road traffic, but also choose different control modes according to the road surface. The biggest highlight is the design of the duration control module, which can automatically adjust the conversion time of the red, yellow and green lights according to the real-time road traffic conditions, effectively improving the road congestion. This device can be used not only at crossroads in urban, but also at crossroads in small cities and villages. We will continue to study on traffic lights in the future. Continuously improve and innovate.</span>
